## Added functionality that makes sense

- grep : fileregex and grepregex and context lines -> output file and line numbers
- changeFile : 

Create an action GrepAction that has parameters like fileRegex and grepRegex (like the ListFilesAction) but returns 
the lines with matches that were found, instead of listing the files. It should also have a parameter contextLines, 
that isn't yet used.
