# Local chat interface that uses the ChatGPT API to simulate a chat

In src/main/resources/static/chat/ we will create chat.html, chat.js, and chat.css . chat.html should load both chat.js
and chat.css and bootstrap. No other libraries than bootstrap should be used - chat.js should be written in vanilla
javascript. All those files will be statically served by the server at /chat/ .

The chatInterfaceSketch.jpg image is a sketch of what the chat interface should look like.

PROMPT: please write a basic version of those files. Create example chat names and example messages in chat.html, so
that I can verify the design.
