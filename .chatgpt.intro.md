List all files using the plugin. Read the chatgpt.codeRules.md and observe the rules that are laid out there during this
whole chat, but you don't need to repeat them.

Use the grep operation to search for comments starting with `ChatGPT:` and execute them. The comment should be replaced
by the new code.

I need a copy of the classes in net.stoerr.chatgpt.devtoolbench at package net.stoerr.chatgpt.jettybench which run with
Jetty instead of Undertow. Let's do that step by step. Please consider DevToolBench, AbstractPluginAction and
ListFilesAction and create the corresponding classes in package jettybench . The resulting program should work the same
way, just based on Jetty , the classes should be named the same way, except for being in package jettybench . Leave out
the other *Action classes for now. Please read the three classes and discuss what's necessary to change. Can you do
that?
