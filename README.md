# Developers ChatGPT ToolBench

Would you like to have ChatGPT list, search, read and modify your local files and have it execute (e.g. build and test)
actions locally to support you in your development processes? Then this might be for you. The Developers ChatGPT
ToolBench can either work as a [ChatGPT plugin](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt-plugins) or provide the actions for a
OpenAI
[GPT](https://openai.com/blog/introducing-gpts) for read or even write access to the files in the local directory it is
started in.

In contrast to other approaches like [AutoGPT](https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/AutoGPT) this is not meant to
autonomously execute extensive changes (which would likely require a lot of prompt engineering), but to enable the
developer to flexibly use the AI within a ChatGPT chat session for various tasks both to analyze code and to make
some changes.

The project is quite stable and useable. In fact I use it regularily in my own development - both on itself and on
my other projects. Using it does, however, require that you have a paid ChatGPT account that can use plugins / GPTs.
