# Command line and configuration

I assume you have [installed](install.md) the program and created a script `developersToolbenchPlugin` in your path
that starts it. With argument -h or --help you get a short help message with the options available.

    version: : DevToolBench version: 2.0
    usage: options are
     -g,--globalconfigdir {arg}   Directory for global configuration (default:
                                  ~/.cgptdevbenchglobal/
     -h,--help                    Display this help message
     -l,--local                   Only use local configuration via options -
                                  ignore any global configuration
     -p,--port {arg}              Port number
     -w,--write                   Permit file writes and action executions

## Global configuration file

The global configuration file defines several properties that are important for the communication with ChatGPT.
Normally it's put into the directory `~/.cgptdevbenchglobal/` and is named `config.properties`, for example:

    gptsecret=examplesecret
    openaitoken=exampletoken

where:

* `gptsecret` XXX
* `openaitoken` XXX

## Local configuration directory

If you have a directory named .cgptdevbench/ in the directory where you start the program, a log file `.requestlog.txt`
will be put there with the requests and responses to ChatGPT. This is useful for debugging or just to see what's going on.

Second, you can put there a number of shell scripts *.sh that can be executed from the program. It's a good idea to
also put a file listActions.sh there that lists the available actions:

```bash
# Plugin Action: list all available actions
cd .cgptdevbench || exit 1
for fil in *.sh; do
  echo "${fil%.sh} :  " $(egrep -o "Plugin Action: .*" "$fil" | sed -e 's/Plugin Action: //')
done
```

It requires a comment `# Plugin Action: ` to be present in each *.sh file that explains the function of the action.

More examples can be found in the
[.cgptdevbench directory of the project](https://github.com/stoerr/DevelopersChatGPTToolBench/tree/develop/.cgptdevbench) .
