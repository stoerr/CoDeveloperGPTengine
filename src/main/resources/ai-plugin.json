  "description_for_model": "Developers Tool Bench allows to inspect a directory and read/write/modify the contents of files using ChatGPT. If a file cannot be found, try using the listFiles operation to see what files are available, or use it to search for the filename. Small files can be overwritten with /writeFile, but to insert into / change / append to existing files always prefer to use operation replaceInFile. (By the way, if you receive an `ApiSyntaxError: Could not parse API call kwargs as JSON: exception=Unterminated string ...` then that usually means that the request was too long. If that happens in a writeFile operation you could use replaceInFile instead to add / change file parts. Similarily, if you receive such an ApiSyntaxError but with `Expecting ',' delimiter`, that often means you tried to concatenate strings with + in the API call, which is not supported - just use a long string.)",
