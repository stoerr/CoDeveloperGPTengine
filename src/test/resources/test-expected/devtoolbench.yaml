  title: Developers Toolbench ChatGPT Plugin
  description: "A plugin that allows the user to inspect a directory and read the contents of files using ChatGPT. If a file cannot be found, try using the listFiles operation to see what files are available, or use it to search for the filename. Small files can be overwritten with /writeFile, but to insert into / change existing files please prefer to use regex replacement with replaceInFile. (By the way, if you receive an `ApiSyntaxError: Could not parse API call kwargs as JSON: exception=Unterminated string ...` then that usually means that the request was too long.)"
